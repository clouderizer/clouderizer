[Clouderizer](https://clouderizer.com) is an end to end MLOps platform for businesses.

### [Showcase](showcase/introduction.md)
Building a machine learning model to solve a real life business problem like Product Recommendation, Predicting Sales or Inventory, is only a small part of overall puzzle. Once built, model needs to be tested, deployed, integrated with business processes and systems, monitored, re-trained and re-deployed. Clouderizer Showcase helps to stitch together these stages in ML model lifecycle and deploy an end to end pipeline which allows enterprises to take their models from RnD & PoC stage to production and create value for their businesses.
