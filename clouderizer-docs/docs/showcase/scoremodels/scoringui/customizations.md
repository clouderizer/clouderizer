Output on the Scoring UI can be complimented with intuitive icons / images / gifs to offer an impressive presentation. This can be configured from Showcase project page -> Output -> Configure. All output variables of type Enums have an additional button *Configure* in their row (Fig 4). Pressing configure, gives option to select an image and specify a text (punch line) for each Enum state (Fig 5). Images can be either uploaded or selected from a builtin gallery. Once configured, save the setting.
