Clouderizer has in-built deep integration with AWS. You can link your Clouderizer account with your AWS account, which allows you to create, configure, manage and delete AWS resources (including spot instances) from Clouderizer console itself. Below are the steps to do so

## Steps
1. [Login](https://showcase.clouderizer.com) to your AWS account (Sign Up in case you donâ€™t have one already)
2. Click on the name of your account (it is located in the top right corner of the console). In the expanded            drop-down list, select My Security Credentials.
