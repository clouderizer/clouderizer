You can configure to automatically download code from any Git repositary on project start. Following are the steps

* Login to your Clouderizer console.
* Create a new project or modify an existing project and go to WORKSPACE tab.
* Enter full http URL of the git repositary.  

In case git repositary is behind Authentication, you can specify the credentials by pressing **Auth** button toward the right end of Code input box.

Once you have saved the Clouderizer project with required git url, you can start this project on any machine of your choice. On start, Clouderizer will automatically download the specified repositary and save it inside **code** folder of clouderizer project.

These code files are backed up in Google Drive in real time. Any changes made to these files, while you work on the project, are also automatically saved to Google Drive (with a latency of upto 1 minute).
